 from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The network has 838,105 nodes and 1,208,613 edges. 
 There are 11,816 connected components, of which the largest one (the GCC) has 730,601 nodes and 1,104,306 edges. 
 The component sizes have a roughly power law distribution with the exponent of -0.026.

The GCC has an excellent community structure: 2009 community, modularity m~0.92. 
The largest community consists of 106,184 nodes.

One of the communities contains references to Sergey Roldugin, Russian cellist and close friend of the Russian president. 
The repository has an SVG file cc32.csv showing the structure of that community. Node sizes represent degrees, 
and colors represent second-level communities. Numeric node names represent "THE BEARER." (Apparently an anonymous official.)
